Where can I find everything I need??
// WRT the main repository
Readme document for the project with steps to execute : README.md
Test Suite : Quote_test/src/test/java/QUOTES_Endpoint/HTTPRequests.java
Test Results : Test Results Log
Test Cases : testcases.xls


Unfortunately, I wasn't able to obtain a proper working output for the FAV QUOTE Endpoint. However, I have included the test case in the suite. 
Issue Faced : 
  > I was able to create a user session after creating a user. 
  > The user session also reflected a User-token which was invoked in the header part of the FAVQUOTE testcase. 
  > But an error is seen saying that ""No user session found"".
Thanks!
