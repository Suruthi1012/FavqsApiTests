Where can I find everything I need??
// WRT the main repository
Readme document for the project with steps to execute : README.md

Test Results : Test Results Log
Test Cases : testcases.xls


I wasn't able to obtain a response for the FAV QUOTE Endpoint. 
However, I have included the test case "testMarkQuoteAsFavorite_after_creating_user_session" in the suite. 

Issue Faced : 
  > I was able to create a user session after creating a user. 
  > The user session also reflected a User-token which was invoked in the header part of the FAVQUOTE testcase. 
  > But an error is seen saying that ""No user session found"".
Thanks!
