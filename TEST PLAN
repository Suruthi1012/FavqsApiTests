		Gson for JSON parsing
	- Dependencies: Ensure internet connectivity and necessary dependencies are installed.


7 Test Scenarios:
i. LIST QUOTES Endpoint:
	Objective: Validate the main functionality of the LIST QUOTES endpoint.
 	Positive Test:
		List all quotes available.
		Validate that the response to check the returned status code.
		Validate that the response to check the body of listed data for the parameters that are not randomised.
	Negative Tests:
		Attempt to get LIST QUOTES with an invalid API Key.
		Attempt to get LIST QUOTES without an API Key for Authorization.

2. User Creation:
	Objective: Verify that a user can be successfully created.
	Positive Test:
		Provide valid login credentials > Login/Passowrd/Email ID
		Validate that a User-Token is returned in the response along with the Login credential.
	Negative Tests:
		Try creating an existing user
	Ensure the proper error responses are received.

	Positive Test:
		Mark a quote as a favorite.
		Validate that the response indicates the quote is marked as a favorite.


Test Execution Strategy
	Sequential Execution:
		Execute the test scenarios in a sequence.

5. Test Data
Credentials:

6. Test Execution
Run the Test Suite: Execute the automated test suite using TestNG.
Logging and Reporting: Refer generated reports from test results.

8. Test Environment Management
Environment Setup: Ensure the test environment is configured correctly.
Data Cleanup: Implement mechanisms to clean up data after test execution.

7. Defect Management
Capture Defects: Record any defects identified during testing.
Defect Classification: Prioritize defects based on severity and impact.


8. Exit Criteria
Pass/Fail Criteria: Define criteria for determining whether the test execution was successful.

9. Test Deliverables
Automation Code: Provide the link to the GitHub repository containing the automation code.
Test Reports: Share generated test reports.

10 Review and Approvals
Review: Conduct a review of the test plan with relevant stakeholders.
Approval: Obtain approval before test execution.
